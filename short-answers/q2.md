# Question

What is the "Request/Response Cycle?"

# Answer

The HTTP Request/Response cycle is the communication pattern between two computers via HTTP. This cycle forms the basis of communication between clients and servers in HTTP-based systems, enabling the exchange of information and actions.

The client, typically a program or computer, initiates the request, while the server, already operational and awaiting requests, responds. The client sends a request containing a URL and a verb (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE), and the server will respond with a status code and a message body. 

Both request and response carry essential details like the requested resource's URL, the action intended, and the outcome.

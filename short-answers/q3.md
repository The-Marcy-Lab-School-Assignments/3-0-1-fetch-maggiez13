# Question

Who sends the HTTP status code: the client or the server? What is the point of the status code?

# Answer

The server sends the HTTP status code as part of the response to the client's request. 

The status code serves to communicate the outcome of the request processing. It informs the client whether the request was successful, encountered an error, or requires further action. 

By interpreting the status code, the client can determine how to proceed, whether to display requested data to the user, retry the request, or handle errors.

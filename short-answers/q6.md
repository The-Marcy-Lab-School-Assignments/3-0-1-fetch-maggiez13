# Question
`fetch` returns a promise of the `Response` object. It has a lot of useful properties on it. Can you explain what each of these properties are for?

- `Response.ok`
- `Response.status`
- `Response.url`
- `Response.headers`

# Answer

1. `Response.ok` - Will return a boolean indicating if the response was successful (status code 200-299). If `true`, it means the request was successful. If `false`, it indicates that the request encountered an error.

2. `Response.status` - Indicates the outcome of the HTTP request. Common status codes include 200 for a successful request, 404 for "Not Found," 500 for "Internal Server Error," etc. This property allows you to programmatically check the status of the response.

3. `Response.url` - Returns the URL of the response. It can be useful, especially if the request was redirected, as it provides the final URL after any re-directions.

4. `Response.headers` - Returns a Headers object, which contains the headers associated with the response. Headers typically include information such as content type, content length, cache-control directives, etc. You can access specific header values using methods provided by the Headers object, such as get(), has(), set(), etc.

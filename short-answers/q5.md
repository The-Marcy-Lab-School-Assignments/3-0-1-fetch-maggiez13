# Question
What are the two arguments that we pass into `fetch` and what do they do? What does `fetch` return?

# Answer

The two arguments that we pass into `fetch` are URL and an options object (optional). 

The URL specifics the URL of the resource that we want to fetch or interact with. 

The options object (optional) is an optional object that allows us to provide additional configurations for the fetch request, such as specifying the HTTP method, headers, body content, etc. 

`fetch` returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object representing the response to the request. This response object contains properties and methods that allow us to access information about the response, such as status, headers, and body content. We can use this response object to handle the data returned by the server and perform further processing as needed.

# Question
Please define what each HTTP verb does. Then, provide an example of when you would use it.

- GET
- POST
- PUT/PATCH
- DELETE

# Answer

1. GET - Read
    
    Example: I would use a GET request to retrieve data from the server, like accessing a user's profile, weather data, pokemon info, etc. For instance, getting an array of users from the data. 

2. POST - Create
  
    I would use a POST request to send data to the server for creating a new resource. For instance, updating a blog page with a new post. 

3. PUT/PATCH - Update

    I would use a PUT/PATCH request to modify existing server data/resources. For instance, when you want to edit/update your blog post or when a user wants to update their profile picture. 

4. DELETE - Delete

    I would use a DELETE request when I want to remove an element/data/resource from the server. For instance, deleting a user account or removing a blog post.

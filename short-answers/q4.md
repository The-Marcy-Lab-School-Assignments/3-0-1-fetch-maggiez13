# Question
Explain what the following status codes mean. Don't just copy and paste the default status text, tell us in your own words what the codes are for.

# Answer

1. 200 - The client's request was successful, indicating that the server processed the request and is sending back the requested data or resource. 

2. 201 - Signifies successful fulfillment of the request and creation of a new resource/data, commonly used for POST requests to create new resources/data.

3. 204 - Indicates successful processing of the request with no content to return in the response body, often used for requests like DELETE where the resource/data has been successfully removed.

4. 404 - This status code denotes that the requested resource is unavailable, often referred to as "Not Found." It is returned when the URL does not exist on the server or when the server cannot locate the requested resource.

5. 500 - Signifies an unexpected server error or inability to fulfill the request due to internal server issues, prompting the client to retry later or contact the server administrator for assistance.
